    <p> Keyan Tabor: Wise beyond his years, Keyan took the time to serve his country before joining Code Fellows! Once his service was complete he needed something new and exciting to fill his time! What a better way to do that then to stare at a computer screen all day filled with a combination of symbols and letters he barely understands! How fun! </p>
