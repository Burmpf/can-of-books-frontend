# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

- We will be able to communicate at all times, but only expect a response within class hours (noon-9pm EST).
- We will ONLY use Slack to communicate outside of Remo
- We will try to take breaks once an hour for 5-10 minutes 
- Our plan if we start to fall behind is to work more hours :)

Keyan's strengths:
- strong willed
- willing to work until the job is done
- great communicator

Mike's strengths:
- Mike isnt here or I'd ask him. We'll miss you Mike!

- These strengths work well to ensure the required work is completed.
- I would like to develop better time management skills. I procrastinate too much!
- day-to-day development wont be an issue! Im SOLO!
- Conflict resolution is no longer an issue!
